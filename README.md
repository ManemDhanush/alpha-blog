# README

Alpha Blog is a Ruby on Rails web application I developed to create a platform for users to share articles and blog posts. Implemented with a RESTful MVC architecture, Alpha Blog has a Rails backend with a SQLite database for persistence and a responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for styling. Key features include user authentication and authorization, article CRUD functionality, WYSIWYG editing with Action Text, pagination, image uploads, comments, likes, search, and more. Developed test suites with RSpec and Capybara for robust testing. Leveraged Git version control and GitHub for collaboration, issue tracking, and project management throughout the development lifecycle. The application demonstrates mastery of core Ruby on Rails concepts like MVC patterns, routing, Active Record associations, validation, callbacks, view templating with ERB, and the Ruby programming language.
